# Customer_segmentation
The goal of this project is to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using K-Means clustering. This helps businesses identify different customer groups for targeted marketing strategies.


# Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning

## Overview
This is a practice project that applies **K-Means Clustering** to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Dataset
- The dataset consists of **Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score**.
- Data is standardized for better clustering.

## Steps Involved
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, normalize data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize distributions and correlations.
3. **Clustering using K-Means:** Determine optimal clusters using the Elbow Method.
4. **Cluster Evaluation:** Use Silhouette Score to measure clustering effectiveness.
5. **Visualization:** Scatter plots to illustrate customer segments.

## Results
- Customers are segmented into **4 distinct groups** based on their income and spending patterns.
- **Silhouette Score:** ~0.28, indicating moderate clustering effectiveness.
